## Issues, Blockers, & Fixes
List any problems you ran into and how you solved them.

- Blocker: After I build the server rack and install the smart switch, it will render some documentation obsolete
- Fix: Finish the rack first, then make network documentation, in the meantime, finish all other documentation

## Results

Add screenshots or commands if needed.
