# Build A Server Rack

## Purpose
As my lab grows and expands, I've noticed that organization is tougher. I want to build a homemade small server rack to house all of my physical components. 

## Goals
- Build a server rack that can hold all current equipment
- Leave room for additional expansion
- Install all equipment inside the rack and ensure everything is connect properly once again
- Add a managed network switch into the homelab

## Steps 
1. Gather materials:
  a. Server rack rails from amazon
  b. A tp-link TL-SG116E smart switch from MicroCenter
  c. Building materials and supplies from Menards 
2. Build the rack
3. Install all equipment:
  a. Design rack mounted hardware
  b. Put items and cables in rack
