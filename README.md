# BlakeNet Homelab

Welcome to my cybersecurity homelab — a fully functional, detection-driven environment built to mirror real-world enterprise infrastructure.  
This repo documents the architecture of my lab, current engineering projects, and completed work that demonstrates my skills in SOC operations, detection engineering, automation, and system administration.

---

## 🔐 Purpose of This Lab
I built this environment to:

- Develop hands-on SOC and detection engineering skills  
- Build and test custom Splunk detections using real logs  
- Practice administering Active Directory and domain-joined Windows systems  
- Experiment with security tools like Sysmon, Pi-hole, n8n, PiVPN, and more  
- Simulate real attack behavior using Atomic Red Team  
- Create a portfolio of practical projects for cybersecurity career growth

## 🧱 Repository Structure

### **/main-lab/**
Documentation for the core architecture of BlakeNet, including:

- Network topology  
- VM & device inventory  
- Services (Splunk, Pi-hole, AD, Sysmon, VPN, etc.)  
- Changelog showing major updates  

This folder represents the stable, always-current state of the homelab.

---

### **/current-projects/**
Active engineering efforts I’m working on.  
Each project is tracked as a simple Markdown file using a lightweight template.

Examples include:
- New detections  
- Lab improvements  
- New security tooling  
- Automation workflows  

---

### **/completed-projects/**
Finished projects that serve as portfolio pieces.  
These documents include purpose, steps taken, issues/fixes, validation, and results.

Examples might include:
- AD domain build  
- Sysmon deployment  
- Splunk correlation searches  
- Pi-hole → Splunk integration  
- VPN configuration  
- Atomic Red Team test results

## 📚 Skills Demonstrated
Through this homelab, I explore and document:

- SIEM engineering (Splunk architecture, ingestion, detection logic)  
- SOC analysis workflows  
- Windows logging (Sysmon, Event Logs, WEF/UFW)  
- DNS filtering & logging with Pi-hole  
- Identity and access management with Active Directory  
- Scripting, automation, and SOAR techniques with n8n  
- Network segmentation and traffic analysis  
- Threat emulation (Atomic Red Team tests)  

---

## 🚀 Future Plans
- Deploy Zeek or Suricata sensors  
- Expand detection coverage mapped to MITRE ATT&CK  
- Build a central SOC dashboard  
- Add a small SOAR system for automated alert enrichment  
- Create more advanced documentation & walkthroughs
