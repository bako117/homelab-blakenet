# Pi-hole

## Overview
Pi-hole acts as the primary DNS sinkhole and ad-filtering service for BlakeNet.
It improves privacy, reduces unwanted traffic, and provides structured DNS logs for Splunk, enabling DNS-based detections such as:
- Suspicious domains
- DNS tunneling patterns
- High-volume request bursts
- Blocked malicious/ad domains
- Device-specific DNS behavior
Pi-hole is a core visibility source for network defense inside the lab.
